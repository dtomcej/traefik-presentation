= Adapting for Production

* LetsEncrypt already works for frontend certificate generation in production
* Using MiniCA for internal generation is production-ready
** Using a custom trust chain is completely production acceptable, assuming:
*** Roots are protected
*** Roots are stored for safe keeping
*** Intermediates are issued for a year or so
*** Leaf certificates are issued for a smaller (90 day) lifetime
