* Verifies the CN of the certificate matches the request
** Easy to ignore
** If ignored, any public certificate will work
** This validation is important to prevent MITM attacks

** How do you generate certificates?
* Backend proxied requests don't have the same host as the main request for validation
** What CN do you use?
