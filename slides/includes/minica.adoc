= Why use MiniCA?

* Dynamic certificate generation
* Written by a member of the LetsEncrypt Team
* Can use our intermediate to sign certificates
* Runs in Docker
* Can run in our pod after the IP and Hostname have been assigned by the kubernetes API

== Our Demo MiniCA Image

* Runs as an init container, and generates our certificates using the downward API
* Stores the issued certificates in a volume
* This volume is then mounted and usable by other containers in our pod
* The signing keys are not available once the init container is gone
* IP SANs are generated, so the certs are valid for the pod IP
