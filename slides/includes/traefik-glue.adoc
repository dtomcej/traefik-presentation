= Traefik Glue

* Traefik is the glue that binds these components together
* We add our intermediate to the trust store in the traefik image
** We bake it in, so we don't have to manage files
** It can also be added as a separate file, and specified via CLI arg
* Traefik will connect to boulder, and will use generated frontend certs
* Traefik will be able to use trusted certificates to connect to backend pod IPs
