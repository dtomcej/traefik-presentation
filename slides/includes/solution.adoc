== Handle Everything Programmatically

* Dynamically generate what you need, when you need it
* Have a Root CA
** Generated, and stored for safe keeping
** Used only for signing intermediates
* Use intermediates for all day-to-day signing

== How are we going to achieve this?

* Two parts:
** Front End (Client facing) TLS
*** Boulder
** Back End (Pod Facing) TLS
*** MiniCA

== Demo Script

* Generates Certificates
** Root CA
** Intermediates
** Browser bundle for importing to client trust
* Bakes intermediates into images (Root also in case of Boulder)
